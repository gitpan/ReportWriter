    Release 0.06

    Added shaded headlines and colored text.
    Note. The method names are in a mess right now. It'll be sorted out
    for the 0.10 release.

    Release 0.05

    Added better support for break headers.
    Borrows some code from Andy Orr's PDF::Report. I only used a small
    fraction of it anyway, and I plan to change and extend the use of
    PDF::API2 in another direction.
    Moved more methods into the base class. A new Writer module only
    needs a handful of lines.
